# Data analysis with Pandas Dataframe: Live coding for beginners
# Abstract:
This seminar is a beginnerâ€™s guide to data analysis with Pandas dataframe, through a live coding session. Pandas is a popular library for manipulating vectors, tables, and time series. We will frequently use Pandas data structures instead of the built-in python data structures, as they provide much richer functionality. Also, Pandas is fast, which makes working with large datasets easier.  In this session, we will use Grand LAgrangian Deployment (GLAD) drifter data, collected by Consortium for Advanced Research on Transport of Hydrocarbon in the Environment (CARTHE)(http://carthe.org/). We will cover three main aspects:
Introduction to Pandas library and Dataframe 
Explore the sample data : GLAD drifter data
Grouping, Indexing and slicing data
